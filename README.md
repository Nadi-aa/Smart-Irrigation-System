This project simulates a smart irrigation system controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The goal is to optimize water usage by making intelligent irrigation decisions based on environmental conditions, plant type, and soil moisture.

The agent learns to:

Minimize water wastage by avoiding over-irrigation.

Maintain soil moisture in the optimal range based on the type of plant.

Adapt to changing weather conditions and time of day.

The environment provides feedback (rewards) based on how well the agent maintains suitable moisture levels with minimal irrigation effort. The RL agent improves its decision-making over time through training
